	<h1> Technology </h1>
		<img src="Tech civic.jpg">
		<p> Technology has played a major role in our everyday lives for a long time. Mostly everyone doesn't even remember when we didn’t have to depend on it so much. Technology has a lot of benefits but it also has ways that affect us negatively. It has basically led a majority of us to have to use it everyday. In fact there is a term that is called nomophobia which is when a person has a fear of losing their phone or being away from their phone for too long. In this day and age we are so dependent on technology for so many reasons. A lot of people use technology for work and there are a lot of jobs that are at home so that means we need technology or the internet to be able to work. The other thing is that schools have switched to a more technology based rather than doing stuff on paper. Majority of the things we use have some sort of technology with it.  </p>

	<h1> Entertainment </h1>

	<p> At the beginning of the 20th century there were many ways people could be entertained. You could go to dances, live events, amusement parks, or play outside with your friends. The way we entertain ourselves has drastically changed. We usually entertain ourselves now by using phones, computers, and other devices. The way we entertain ourselves nowadays has changed a lot since covid because everyone was stuck inside. And honestly it’s gonna continue to be like this because technology is changing everyday. </p>

	<h1> Life Style </h1>
	<p> In today's world everything about technology has changed and we use it so much. It could be from ordering food online to working remotely, or even booking a hotel room. There are just so many things that you can do with technology or the internet. And if we couldn’t use technology we would be in trouble because we depend on technology too much. </p>

	<h1> Health </h1>
	<p> We use technology for our health a lot as well. It could be just from counting your macros to using it for workouts. We also use apps that will help us with our health and we also have watches that track our steps and other health related things. We use technology a lot for our health. Technology can also affect our health in a bad way. It causes people that are Video Game addicts to stay inside for weeks and that's bad for their health. It's also bad for your mental health because when your on the internet more sometimes isn't good for your mental health. </p>

	<h1> Social Interactions </h1>
	<p> In today's world a lot of our Social Interactions have been pushed to online either by the internet or telephone service. Yes people still are socially active in person but not as much as people used to. And this graph will show you that.</p>

	<h1> My Opinion </h1>
	<p> I feel that it would have a big impact on today’s society because everyone is addicted to their phones or computers. A Lot of people also use their phones or computers for  work, talking to people, and paying bills. So nowadays a lot more people work from home since covid because they never just returned to their office. So if they couldn’t use their computers or telephones then they wouldn’t be able to work. Also with the school there really isn’t such a thing of doing stuff on paper anymore it’s all digital so it would have a huge impact on school.  I think nowadays that if the internet or telephone services would stop working it would be really bad. Because the majority of the stuff we have we need the internet. Like alot of our entertainment comes from the internet like some people use streaming services so you need the internet for that. Yes people still go out and do stuff for entertainment but I feel it’s way less than what it used to be. Also a lot of kids nowadays don’t really go outside because they're either playing video games or on their phones. I feel they wouldn’t know what to do. Regarding technology as a whole we have become very dependent on it since covid happened and it’s really just become our new normal. Yes there might be a lot of benefits of using technology, we just don’t need to become too dependent on it. </p>
